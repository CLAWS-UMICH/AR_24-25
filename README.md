# Collaborative Lab for Advancing Work in Space, AURA, 2024-2025

CLAWS is a student-run organization affiliated with the college of Engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. We participate in an annual student challenge led by NASA aimed at creating an Augmented Reality application for astronauts displays. 

## Installation

Unity version: 2022.3.71f 

MRTK3 was used to develop for the Hololens 2

Windows is needed to configure the MRTK3 packages as Microsoft requires you to use their tool. Read more about configuring the Unity project [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vLJ98uiUNSCTeldjaDFKwF7CTjQHwHTLx3sduLSyuy8/edit?usp=sharing), but  simply downloading Unity Hub and opening this project after running should work: 

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CLAWS-UMICH/AR_24-25.git
```
